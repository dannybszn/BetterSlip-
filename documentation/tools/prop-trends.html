            <h2>Understanding Hit Rates</h2>

            <h3>📊 How Hit Rate is Calculated</h3>
            <p>Hit rate is calculated by looking at a player's recent games and counting how many times they exceeded a specific stat line. If a player hit over 7.5 rebounds in 7 out of 10 games, their hit rate for that line is 70%.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher hit rates (70%+)</strong> indicate more consistent performance at that level</li>
                <li><strong>Lower hit rates (40-60%)</strong> indicate more volatile or inconsistent performance</li>
                <li><strong>Very low hit rates (under 40%)</strong> may indicate the line is set too high for that player</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🎯 What Makes a Good Prop Trend?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistent Hit Rate:</strong> 70%+ hit rate over last 5-10 games</li>
                <li><strong>No Recent Drop-Off:</strong> Hitting in recent games, not just older ones</li>
                <li><strong>Favorable Matchup:</strong> Playing against a team that allows the stat</li>
                <li><strong>Good Odds:</strong> Reasonable juice that doesn't eliminate the edge</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="success-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Look for trends where a player has hit 7+ times in their last 10 games. This indicates consistent performance, not just a hot streak that may not continue.
            </div>

            <h2>Live Progress Tracking</h2>

            <h3>⚡ Real-Time Updates</h3>
            <p>During games, our Live Progress feature shows exactly how close each player is to hitting their prop line:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual Progress Bars:</strong> See completion percentage for each stat</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Stats:</strong> Current game stats updated every few seconds</li>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>

            <ol class="step-list">
                <li><strong>Don't Chase Streaks:</strong> A high hit rate should be consistent, not just a recent hot streak.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Matchups:</strong> Verify the player isn't facing an unusually tough opponent for that stat.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor Injuries:</strong> Check if key teammates are out, which can affect volume.</li>
                <li><strong>Compare Multiple Lines:</strong> Sometimes a slightly different line offers much better value.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Best Odds:</strong> Always place your bet at the sportsbook with the best odds.</li>
            </ol>
